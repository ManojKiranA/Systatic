Systatic is a modern static site generator for developers to build fast sites.

* **Use your own stack** Apart from using PHP to generate your site, you can use whatever tech stack you want, Vue, React, whatever. We don't dictate what you need.
* **No more servers** Because Systatic generates HTML files, you can host your site anywhere you can put HTML files: Netlify, Github Pages, Amazon S3.
* **Data from everywhere** You can put your data whereever you want. You could have it in Markdown files, WordPress or even a headless CMS and it will all work and feel the same.
