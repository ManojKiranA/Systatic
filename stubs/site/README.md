# Systatic Project

This project is built with [Systatic](https://systatic.co), a simple, modern and flexible static site generator. This readme details all you need to know to easily develop and maintain your Systatic project.

## ðŸ’» Getting setup

As long as you have PHP and Composer installed, you should be good to go! You may optionally use your own web server, like Nginx or Laravel Valet. However, it's technically not required.

### 1. Install Composer dependencies

```
composer install
```

### 2. Build your site

```
php systatic build
```

### 3. Get to work!

Now you can start working on your new Systatic project! 

## Useful things to know
* If you'd like to spin up a local development server, you can run `php systatic serve`.
* If you don't like our directory structure, it's flexible. You can change whatever you want, [read about configuration](https://systatic.co/docs/configuration).
* If you need any help, jump into our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zSg3MHv) and ask for help!
